## First Commit

It is just a auto program now, not a easy tool. By using the excel and program, you can obtain the results automatically.

However, this is not a qualified program. I will improve it, add some visualable content and make it can be easily used.ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿

## Second Commit

Now,it could be called a quick and auto script. However, let discuss the way of paper, we will find that 
there are many details to work out. For example, I call it situation A, if only one person get out, when the probability make all approximately 0,
this is obviously incorrect. Therefore, When OD does not match the total flow, what should we do then?
Unfortunately, the article seems to not provide a precise example.

This is what I want to express: boundary conditions and integers distinguishing is not 
accurate.

In this script, I find the max probability and give it the only 1 person as a
 easy solution. As for ather question, this commit does not give any solution.

On the other hand, From a probabilistic perspective, the method of normalizing the Poisson distribution probability
in the article also seems to have some doubts.

Anyway, this version can be used as a homework tool. Answer is saved in output.
